  Even if you disagreed with the outcome of a credit decision or a court case, there may still not be any mistake.

  In order for a record to have been sealed, you or your attorney must have asked a court to seal the record.

  Para que un registro haya sido sellado, usted o su abogado deben haber pedido a un tribunal que lo selle.

question: | 
  Request to seal eviction records
subquestion: | 
  If you have an eviction on your record, you can always ask a court to seal the record. 
  
  There are two kinds of evictions. 
  
  The first is when you are evicted because the bank took the building back from your landlord. This is a **foreclosure-related eviction**.
  
  The court must seal a **foreclosure-related eviction**.
  
  The second is when you are evicted for another reason. This is a **non-foreclosure related eviction**. 
  
  In this case, the court can choose whether to seal the eviction or not.

  Do you want to try to seal an eviction on your record?
decoration: question
yesno: eviction_to_seal
section: evict
help: | 
  <br />
  Sealing the eviction will prevent the record from appearing in future screening reports.

  Solicitud para sellar los registros de desalojo
subquestion: | 
  Si usted tiene un desalojo en su expediente, siempre puede pedirle a la corte que lo selle. 
  
  Hay dos tipos de desalojos. 
  
  La primera es cuando usted es desalojado porque el banco le quitó el edificio al propietario. Este es un desalojo relacionado con una ejecución hipotecaria.
  
  El tribunal debe sellar un **desalojo relacionado con la ejecución hipotecaria**.
  
  La segunda es cuando usted es desalojado por otra razón. Este es un desalojo no relacionado con una ejecución hipotecaria. 
  
  En este caso, el tribunal puede optar por sellar o no el desalojo.

  ¿Quiere intentar sellar un desalojo en su expediente?

  Sellar el desalojo evitará que el registro aparezca en futuros informes de revisión.

  Request to seal criminal records
subquestion: | 
  Let's take the records you were not able to expunge and see if they are eligible to be sealed.
  
  When a record is sealed, the court hides it from public viewing. The record still exists, however.
  
  Do you have any of those records in your report?

  Criminal convictions that fall under a specific list of misdemeanors or felonies are usually eligible to be sealed.
  
  Keep in mind that you will need to ask the court to seal the charge, and the court will need to agree.

  SCREENING REPORT REQUESTS

We also retain information on your behalf, such as the Personal Data described above and any correspondence. If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, IP address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us. If we conduct a survey in which you participate, we may collect additional profile information. We may also collect Personal Data at other instances in the Site where we state that Personal Data is being collected.

  We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information, except as specifically provided for in this Privacy Policy. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

  PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES
  
  This Privacy Policy applies only to the use and disclosure of Personal Data that we collect while you use the Site. Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Site and go to another site. During this process, a third party may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you.

  PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLOGY

We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and/or access to the Site and your activity on the Site. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit the Site.

  “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site.
