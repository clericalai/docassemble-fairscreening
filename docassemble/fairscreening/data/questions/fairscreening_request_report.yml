  We will send out a request to the screening company you selected.

  Because you don't know the screening company that your landlord used, we will send out requests to all of the companies listed on Fair Screening.
  
  A screening company usually has a file on you if a landlord has requested a copy of your report. It is likely that some of the screening companies on our list will not have any files on you. If that is the case, you will receive a letter from each company explaining whether or not they have a file about you.

  Upload your photo ID. 
subquestion: | 
  You need to upload a government ID. These types of IDs are most common: **driver's license, state ID, passport, or green card**.

  Screening companies usually require a copy of a government ID to release your screening report. 
  
  If you don't upload a valid ID, you won't get a report. Instead, you'll get a response back from the screening company, asking you to provide valid ID.

  This is the question where the user uploads a photo of their ID.
  If the user is accessing the app on a smartphone, the app will access the smartphone camera to take a picture.
  If the user is accessing the app on a desktop computer, the app will allow the user to upload a photo from the hard drive.
  Validation code limits acceptable files to 1 page, as there's no need to upload multiple page shere.

  Last Updated: April 2, 2018

 
  This Fair Screening Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal and company information when you visit Fairscreening.com (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and considered a part of, the Fair Screening Terms of Service, currently located at Terms of Use. Any terms not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.

  MEMBER CONSENT
  
  Fair Screening will collect no personal information about you unless you choose to provide that information to us. If you do nothing during your visits but browse throughout our website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. By submitting or making available Personal Data (as defined below) through the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

  By using our site, you consent to the Site's Privacy Policy.
 
  Please also visit our Terms of Use section establishing the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of the Site.
 
  SCREENING REPORT REQUESTS
 
  Fair Screening includes a function to request a tenant screening report from a variety of companies that offer this service ("Screening Company"). We may include personal data you provide in your automated request for a screening report. We send this data through electronic fax, directly to the fax number of the Screening Company. Once the fax is sent to the Screening Company, Fair Screening is not responsible for how the Screening Company may use or store your personal data.

  TYPES OF PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT
  
  Fair Screening collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit the Site. “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, geographic location of your computer or mobile device, telephone number, and email address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data about you that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
 
  PERSONAL DATA YOU PROVIDE TO US
  
  We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, email and mailing addresses, telephone number, and password, when you register for the Site. We also retain information on your behalf, such as the Personal Data described above and any correspondence. If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, IP address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us. If we conduct a survey in which you participate, we may collect additional profile information. We may also collect Personal Data at other instances in the Site where we state that Personal Data is being collected.

  We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information, except as specifically provided for in this Privacy Policy. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

  PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES
  
  This Privacy Policy applies only to the use and disclosure of Personal Data that we collect while you use the Site. Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Site and go to another site. During this process, a third party may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on a link to or for a third party.

  PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLOGY
  
  The Site (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collects Personal Data from you, such as browser type, geographic location of your mobile device or computer, operating system and version, Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name, information about your application, operating environment and hardware profiles and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and/or access to the Site and your activity on the Site. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit the Site.

  “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them, or for an extended period of time) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience while using the Site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Site may not function correctly. We use cookies to help us understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

  Some browsers may allow you to manage the storage of cookies on your device. If supported by your browser, you may set your browser to refuse all cookies (or, sometimes all third-party cookies) or to alert you when a cookie is set. However, if you select these settings, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting to refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies. For more information about how to manage your cookies preferences, use the ‘help’ menu of your web browser or explore the customer support sections of your web browser.

  DO NOT TRACK NOTICE 
  
  Your browser may provide you with the option to send a “Do Not Track” signal to websites you visit. This signal is used to request that websites not send the requesting device cookies, but websites have no obligation to respond to such signal or to modify their operation. At the current time, the Site is not programmed to recognize Do Not Track signals, so the Site will not treat you differently if we receive such signals from your browser and we may not comply with Do Not Track settings on your browser.

  WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
  
  We collect information from you when you register on the Site. When registering on the Site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, e-mail address, mailing address and/or phone number.
